# packer-config Release Notes

## 0.0.4

* Added the ability to call `#build` with a quiet option. This option turns streaming to stdout off/on. With `quiet: false`, you will see the output of the Packer call on your screen while `#build` is executing it. This can be handy for view Packer status for long running Packer jobs.
* Started writing release notes!
